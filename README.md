# Module 2 Stock-Analysis Challenge
The code from the homework was refactored so that different ticker values could be stored, but kept the number in the array at 12. I used the knowledge that the stocks would be sorted to make the ticker name in A2 as the first value stored in the tickers array.

Arrays were also created for the total volume, starting and ending prices. These values were stored as certain conditions were met. The total volume was stored after all values had been found for that ticker index, then the ticker index value was increased. I then stored the next ticker name to continue with the analysis. The output data was then created using the arrays that had been stored.
